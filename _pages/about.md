Hi, I'm Sam Tello and I'm a fourth year undergraduate physics, math, and computer science student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). 

My research experience so far has consisted of experimental and recently more theoretical neutrino physics. If you're curious about what I've been up to this Summer, please click the "Research" header at the top of the page!
