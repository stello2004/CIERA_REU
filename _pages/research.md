## Introduction

My 2025 REU research project at Northwestern University’s CIERA was focused on testing the sensitivity of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to oscillation parameters associated with solar neutrinos. DUNE is optimized to measure atmospheric oscillation parameters, but it is useful to see how well it can constrain solar parameters. This makes for a useful consistency check and confirms some of DUNE’s weaknesses.

## Results

I simulated expected event rates at DUNE using different oscillation parameter assumptions. Event spectra were integrated and binned to resemble detector data, and the results were compared using χ² tests. As expected, DUNE shows limited sensitivity to variations in θ₁₂ and Δm²₂₁ compared to experiments optimized for solar neutrinos.

The analysis also showed features in the χ² dependence on θ₁₂ that will require investigation. Future work will also involve considering detector effects like noise and energy resolution to perform a more accurate analysis.
